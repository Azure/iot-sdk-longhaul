## serviceAckResponse c2d messages

`serviceAckResponse` messages are used to acknowledge events that the device app is unable to observe.
A `serviceAckId` could represent a telemetry message, a reported property write, or any other operation that needs to be verified by the service.
The `serviceAckId` is created by the device and passed to the service app as part of an operation.
When the service app verifies that operation, it returns the `serviceAckId` to the device inside a `serviceAckResponse` c2d message.
When the device receives an operation's `serviceAckId` back, it knows that the operation has been verified by the service app.
Because c2d is a fairly expensive operation, the service app gathers `serviceAckIds` in batches to send to the device app.

```json
  {
    "thief": {
      "cmd": "serviceAckResponse",
      "serviceInstance": "ca3ceadb-ac57-4cca-8f9b-c5d1e4dc189d",
      "runId": "3887e97e-6f06-484b-a5bf-1753913866d3",
      "serviceAcks": [

      ]
    }

| `serviceInstance` | guid | Guid for the service app sending the `serviceAckResponse`. |

## test telemetry with serviceAckRequest properties

Telemetry is tested by sending a telemetry message with a `serviceAckId`.
When the service app receives telemetry with `cmd` == `serviceAckRequest`, it acknowledges receipt by returning the `serviceAckId` to the device app inside a `serviceAckResponse` c2d message.

```json
  {
    "thief": {
      "cmd": "serviceAckRequest",
      "serviceInstance": "ca3ceadb-ac57-4cca-8f9b-c5d1e4dc189d",

## test reported properties

Reported properties are tested by adding an object to `properties/reported/thief/testContent/reportedPropertyTest` with a pair of `serviceAckId` guids.
When the service app observes the add of the property, it returns the `addServiceAckId` to the device app inside a `serviceAckResponse` c2d message.
When the device receives the `addServiceAckId` back from the service, it proceeds to remove the property.
When the service app observes the removal of hte property, it returns the `removeServiceAckId` to the device app inside a `saerviceAckResponse` c2d message.

```json
  {
    "reported": {
      "thief": {
        "testContent": {
          "reportedPropertyTest": {

## test c2d messages

When c2d testing is enabled (via `properties/reported/thief/testControl/c2d`), the service sends a continuous stream of c2d messages using the configuration stored in the `testControl/c2d` structure.
The device app uses the `testC2dMessageIndex` value to keep track of messages received from the service, including dropped messages.

```json
  {
    "thief": {
      "cmd": "testC2d",
      "serviceInstance": "3e5917f2-3625-4431-92fa-45b184a25498",
      "runId": "64186b84-48d3-4831-8f09-85edc31dc133",
      "testC2dMessageIndex": 0
    }
  }
```
