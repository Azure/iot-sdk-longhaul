## Columns

| column name | meaning |
| - | - |
| variable name | name of the environment variable |
| service | variable is available to service apps when running inside Azure container instances |
| device | variable is available to device apps when running inside Azure container instances |

## Keyvault conventions
Since keyvault doesn't support underscores in secret names, keyvault secrets are names the same as the variable names, with underscores (\_) replaced with dashes (-)

e.g. The environment variable `THIEF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` is stored as a keyvault seret named `THIEF-SUBSCRIPTION-ID`

## Azure resources
