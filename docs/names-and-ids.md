# Names and IDs

version .1

There are a number of names and IDs used in THIEF.  This table describes some of them:

| Identifier | format | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| servicePool | string | Name of pool that a service app belongs to. |
| requestedServicePool | string | Name of pool that a device app would like to pair with. |
| runId | guid | Guid representing a running executable. |
| serviceAppRunId | guid | Guid representing a running _service_ executable. |
| sessionId | guid | Guid representing the pairing between a device app and a service app. |
| pingbackId | guid | Guid used to represent the ACK of a thief operation. |

## servicePool notes
* A service pool contains one or more running service apps.
* Each running service app belongs to exactly one pool.
* Service pools were added to support a fallback scenario where a device could detect a non-responsive service app and decide to pair with a different service app.
* Since service fallback isn't implemented, there currently no advantage to having more than one service app in any given pool.

## requestedServicePool notes
* A device specifies the nam of a service pool that it would like to pair with.
* The device _must_ specify a requested service pool.
* Any service app in the requested pool can pair with the device app.
* A service app cannot pair with a device app that is requesting a different pool.
* If no service apps are available in the device's requested pool, the pairing fails. 

## runId notes
* Every time a service or device app launches, it gets a new runId value.
* For development scenarios, optional `THIEF_DEVICE_APP_RUN_ID` and `THIEF_SERVICE_APP_RUN_ID` environment variables can be used.  (These variables used to be more important.  They are less useful at this point and might be unnecessary.)

## serviceAppRunId notes
* When a device pairs with a service app, it records the service app's runId and uses this ID when communicating with the service app.
* The service app uses the presence of its serviceAppRunId in a device message to know that pairing is established (or broken) 

## sessionId notes
* Every time a device app pairs with a service app, it gets a new sessionId value.
* sessionId was added to support service app fallback.  If a run pairs with the same service app a second time, the runIds would remain unchanged but a new sessionId would be allocated. 

## pingbackId notes
* When the device app needs the service app to verify some behavior, it includes a pingackId ID in the verification request.
* When the service app verifies the behavior, it sends a pingbackResponse message to the decvice which includes the appropriate pingbackId.
